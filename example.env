# - Issues assigned to you: "assignee = currentUser()"
# - Issues you reported: "reporter = currentUser()"
# - High priority issues: "priority = High"
# - Recent issues: "created >= -7d"
# - Open issues: "status != Done"
# - Custom field: "customfield_10000 = 'value'"

# - Order by: "project = DEMO ORDER BY created DESC"
